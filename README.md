# Robot Factory
  - This is the first time I've used TypeScript in React
  - Im not yet fully comfortable in unit testing React Components with Jest & Enzyme

I used React using Create React App in TypeScript, Redux, Jest and Redux Saga.

### Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/rrcc0044/robot-factory-web.git
$ cd robot-factory-web
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

### Run tests
```
$ yarn test
```

The app will run on http://localhost:3000

### Extinguish Fire From Robots
  - I've initially added the on fire robots in the `for recycle list`. `Right Click` on the Robot to extinguish the fire & if it happens that after the fire has been taken out and the Robot is not recyclable anymore, it will go in the `For QA` list.
